# Introduction

Gym City is a webpage built to get users to sign up to the gym as well as informing them of the locations, facilities, prices and members of staff. Personally I have always been passionate about fitness so the opportunity to build a website for a gym excited me, I made the webiste user friendly and includng the content that id like to see if i were going to join a new gym.

This is my first Milestone Project for my Full Stack Development Program at Code Institute, in which i was given instructions to make a static and responsive website including at least 3 pages. In creating this page i used CSS3 and HTML5.
