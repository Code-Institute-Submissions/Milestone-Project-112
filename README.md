# Introduction

Gym City is a web page built to get users to sign up to the gym as well as informing them of the locations, facilities, prices and members of staff. Personally, I have always been passionate about fitness so the opportunity to build a website for a gym excited me, I made the website user friendly and including the content that I'd like to see if I were going to join a new gym.

This is my first Milestone Project for my Full Stack Development Program at Code Institute, in which i was given instructions to make a static and responsive website including at least 3 pages. In creating this website I used CSS3 and HTML5.

# UX

## Goals
  

  
* To make GYM CITY look premium and reliable to the customer
* To create an aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate webpage for the customer
* Easy for the customer to sign up
* To make a responsive and eye catching website across all devices

 
## User Stories

1. I am a user who would like to sign up to GYM CITY to begin my fitness journey
1. I am a user who is currently a member of another gym looking at what GYM CITY has to offer instead
1. I am a manager of a different gym looking at what the competition has to offer
1. I am a user who primarily uses a mobile phone and would like the website to function and look good on my mobile
1. I am a user who is trying to find out the locations of GYM CITY in the UK


## Design Process

1. I started my process by planning out what I wanted to include in my website and what the pages should be. I settled on including a "Home Page", "Locations Page", "Gallery Page" and a. "Sign Up Page". 
1. I wanted to keep my website aesthetically pleasing, so I decided on a simple but nice to look at colour scheme and one font to use throughout the entire web page. The colours and font I used were: <br>
   #fafafa <br>
   #16A5B9 <br>
   Red Hat Display <br>
 I found this combination nice to look at yet still maintained the modern, streamlined appearance I was aiming for.
1. I wireframed my project using FIGMA. I used the colour wheel to find the exact shade I wanted and used this throughout the project. I created my pages for desktop layout first setting out the basics of the page and once that was completed I made the mobile version of the website. I made changes throughout the design process following input from family, friends and my mentor
1. I then took this wireframe and proceeded to put it together on gitpod, changing some minor aspects of the website and adding new features that I discovered along the way. The main change I made was adding the "Gallery Page" which initially wasn't on my wireframe.


## Figma Wireframe

Throughout the process of coding my website and input from other people, a few improvements were made to the website to not only make it look more profesional but also to include more useful features.

1. The user wished to see what GYM CITY had to offer versus their current gym, to find this information out they scrolled down on the main page to read what the gym has to offer along with the membership prices and features for each one.
