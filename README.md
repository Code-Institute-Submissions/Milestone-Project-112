# Introduction

Gym City is a webpage built to get users to sign up to the gym as well as informing them of the locations, facilities, prices and members of staff. Personally I have always been passionate about fitness so the opportunity to build a website for a gym excited me, I made the webiste user friendly and includng the content that id like to see if i were going to join a new gym.

This is my first Milestone Project for my Full Stack Development Program at Code Institute, in which i was given instructions to make a static and responsive website including at least 3 pages. In creating this page i used CSS3 and HTML5.

## Design Process

1. I started my process by planning out what I wanted to include in my website and what the pages should be. I settled on including a "Home Page", "Locations Page", "Gallery Page" and a. "Sign Up Page". 
1. I wanted to keep my website aesthetically pleasing so I decied on a simple but nice to look at colour scheme of an off white colour as the page colour ("#fafafa") and a baby blue colour for text and buttons ("#16A5B9"), I found this combination nice to look at yet still remaining the modern streamlined appearence
1. I wireframed my project using FIGMA. I used the colour wheel to find the exact shade I wanted and used this throughout the project. I created my pages for desktop layout first setting out the basics of the page and once that was completed i made the mobile version for the website. I made changes throughout the design process following input by family, friends and my mentor
1. I then took this wireframe and proceeded to putting it together on gitpod, changing some minor aspects of teh website and adding new feautres that i discovered along the way. The main change i mae was adding the "Gallery Page" which initially wasnt on my wireframe.
