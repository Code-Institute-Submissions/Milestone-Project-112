Live Demo

<img src="assets/images/responsive.jpg">


## Introduction

Gym City is a webpage built to get users to sign up to the gym as well as informing them of the locations, facilities, prices and members of staff. Personally I have always been passionate about fitness so the opportunity to build a website for a gym excited me, I made the webiste user friendly and includng the content that id like to see if i were going to join a new gym.

This is my first Milestone Project for my Full Stack Development Program at Code Institute, in which i was given instructions to make a static and responsive website including at least 3 pages. In creating this page i used CSS3 and HTML5.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
